## IMPORTANT NOTES:

### Cancellation Best Practices:
- Most services allow you to use the subscription until the current billing period ends
- Save all confirmation emails
- Check your credit card/bank statement next month to verify charges stopped
- Some services may offer a discount to keep you - decline if you don't need it

### If You Can't Find Cancellation:
1. Check your email for the original subscription confirmation
2. Look for "manage subscription" links in billing emails
3. Contact support directly (usually faster than searching)
4. If paid through PayPal or App Store, cancel through those platforms
