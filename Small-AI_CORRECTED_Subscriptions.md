**Conservative estimate:**
- Claude Pro: $30
- iCloud Storage: $5
- GoDaddy: $80 (if monthly) OR $7 (if annual divided by 12)
- AWS: $33
- Apple TV: $16 (personal, not business)

**Business Total: $68-141/month** (depending on GoDaddy frequency)

## CRITICAL QUESTION TO RESOLVE:

**Is your GoDaddy charge of $79.99 MONTHLY or ANNUAL?**

This makes a huge difference:
- If monthly: ~$141/month business spend
- If annual: ~$68/month business spend

Can you check your GoDaddy account or last receipt to confirm?

## BOTTOM LINE:

You were absolutely right to question my numbers! Your actual spend is:
- ✅ Adobe CANCELLED (saved ~$97/month)
- ✅ iCloud is $5, not $28 (I was wrong)
- ❓ GoDaddy needs verification ($80/mo or $80/year?)

**Your subscription management is EXCELLENT.** 

You're running lean - this is a well-optimized stack!
